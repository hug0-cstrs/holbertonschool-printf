NAME
_printf - format and print data

SYNOPSIS

#include <main.h>

_printf(const char *format, ...);


DESCRIPTION

The _printf function formats and prints data to the standard output stream stdout.

The first argument, format, is a string that specifies the format of the output. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream, and conversion specifications, each of which results in the conversion and printing of the next successive argument.

The conversion specifications start with the % character, followed by optional flags, field width, precision, and length modifier characters, and end with a conversion specifier character that determines the type of conversion to be applied.

The arguments following the format string are the values to be converted and printed, corresponding to the conversion specifications in the format string.

The function returns the number of characters written to the output stream, or a negative value if an error occurs.


RETURN VALUE

Upon successful completion, _printf() returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). If an output error occurs, the function returns a negative value.



EXAMPLES

The following code prints "Hello, world!" to the standard output stream:
_printf("Hello, world!\n");

The following code prints the value of an integer variable:
int x = 42;
_printf("The value of x is %d\n", x);
